<p>What I like to do in my free time is play video games. It is the chance I get when I don't have to worry about anything except just having fun. I like to play games varying from Pokemon all the way to Madden. I think video games are the best hobby because anyone can enjoy themselves. You can either play by yourself or play with other people. Either way you can have a lot of fun. I like to play sports games the most because everyone you know are always trying to get better at the sports game that you play. This leads me to the inspiration for this page.<a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/phi">The Best Sports Website Ever</a>. ESPN has been a sports network that I have watched for as long as I can remember.</p>
